Project Name: Library Management System:

There are two personas:

Librarian: He/She can add new books, remove old books, issue books to members, collect books from members and maintain a record of the number of units of each book present in the library
Member: He/She can lend books from the Library. When a Book is lent, the number in the inventory gets reduced by 1 and when it is returned, the number in the inventory gets increased by 1. At a given point in time, a member can borrow only one copy of one book. He/She can borrow multiple books, but not more than one copy of one book
Librarians and Members have First Names, and Last Names and can authenticate themselves via Email and Password

A Librarian can also lend out books for himself/herself

Librarians and Members must authenticate themselves while logging in and a person who is just a Member cannot issue/collect books

A Book has the following properties:

Title
Description
No. of Units in the inventory
When I log in as a Librarian, I should be able to see:

No. of units of each book present in the library
Which Member has borrowed which books and when was the same borrowed
What are the books that I have borrowed
I should be able to reset my existing password or if I forget my password, I should be able to reset it without logging in
When I log in as a Member, I should be able to see:

What are the books that I have borrowed
What are the books that are in the Library that I may borrow
I should NOT see what other members have borrowed
I should be able to reset my existing password or if I forget my password, I should be able to reset it without logging in
